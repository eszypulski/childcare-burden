<h2>This is the page where my visualizations will live. </h2>
<p>Here are my draft visualizations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="area_graph.html">An area graph that shows median household income over time, as well as average infant childcare cost over the same period.</a></li>
    <li><a href="squeeze_graph.html">A vertical normalized chart illustrating the “squeeze” of rising housing costs and rising childcare costs over time, both reflected as a percentage of household income.</a></li>
</ul>
