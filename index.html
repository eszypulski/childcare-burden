<div id="header"><h2>Two Views of Childcare Affordability in America's Most Populous Counties</h1>
<p>In the United States, the largest counties have the highest childcare costs. These visualizations use data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs">Census Bureau's American Community survey</a> and the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare?_ga=2.142768381.913735267.1716344759-1093376893.1714408553">National Database of Childcare Prices</a> to examine the burden this places on American families.</p> 
<p>The five most populous counties in the United States are:
    <ul>
        <li>Los Angeles County, California</li>
        <li>Cook County, Illinois</li>
        <li>Harris County, Texas</li>
        <li>Maricopa County, Arizona</li>
        <li>San Diego County, California</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Note: The most recent data from the National Database of Childcare Prices is from 2018. Smaller surveys from the past six years suggest that the price of childcare has gone up dramatically since then, especially in the post-pandemic years. Centers across the country have shut down, leaving fewer slots for children and driving higher prices. </p>

        <h3>Median Household Income and Median Infant Care Costs</h3>
   <p>This graph compares median household income from 2008 - 2018 (shown in gray) with the average cost of care for one infant at a licensed childcare center (shown in <span class="green">green</span>). </p>
   <p>According to the federal government, affordable childcare should account for no more than 7% of a family's total income. In these counties, as well as the majority of counties across the country, the cost of childcare far exceeds what is considered affordable by this standard.</p>

        <h3>The Squeeze: Childcare and Rent as a Percentage of Household Income, 2018</h3>
        <p>This graph shows childcare (in <span class="blue">blue</span>) and average rental costs (in <span class="green">green</span>) as percentages of median household income. The gray portion is the percentage of income an average household would have left after paying for childcare and rent each month. This is the money left for food, utilities, car payments, debt, savings, clothing, medical bills, and any other expenses a family might encounter.</div>
